# Solitaire-Solver
A peg solitaire solving AI, implemented in the C programming language.
This program fully utilizes a DFS (depth-first search) algorithm for the AI. 
I think the significance of this project comes from this entire project being implemented in the C programming language. At a fundamental level I implemented performing a DFS for the AI to find a solution, as well as freeing all used memory on the RAM.
