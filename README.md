# Solitaire-Solver
A peg solitaire solving AI, implemented in the C programming language.
This program fully utilizes a DFS (depth-first search) algorithm for the AI. 

# What I learnt:
- As this was written in the C programming language I not only learned performing DFS for the AI to find the solution, but also traversing the tree to free all used memory in the RAM.
